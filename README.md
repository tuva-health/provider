# Provider

## üß∞ What does this project do?

The Tuva Provider project combines and transforms messy public provider datasets into usable data.
This project contains the transformations we use to create the clean datasets for users of the Tuva Project. 
We have made this project public to share our methodology and code. 

You can easily load the cleaned provider data into your data warehouse by using [Tuva Terminology package](https://github.com/tuva-health/terminology).

2. You have created a database for the output of this project to be written in your data warehouse.
3. You have downloaded the source data and loaded it into your data warehouse.
   * NPI Data from [NPPES](https://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html)
   * Provider Taxonomy from [NUCC](https://nucc.org/index.php/code-sets-mainmenu-41/provider-taxonomy-mainmenu-40/csv-mainmenu-57)
